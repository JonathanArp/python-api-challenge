# python-api-challenge

You will find both homework problems complete and the analysis written where prompted.
**Please note the files include "-Copy1" as I created copies to work off of so I could look at the output from the orginal to make sure mine matched**

Additionally, the images for the maps do not show on the homework, but work when the code runs. I believe this has something to do with the "%%capture --no-display", but I wanted to clarify. If you would like me to submit images of them, please request and I will upload.
